In the "[client-samples](https://github.com/peter-szrnka/give-my-secret/tree/main/client-samples)" folder you can find pure client examples for Java, Go, Python and NodeJs to call your GMS instance, but in the future (if there's a need for that) fully working client libraries will be available.

# Postman collection
In the GMS's [Postman collection](https://github.com/peter-szrnka/give-my-secret/tree/main/postman) you can find a big collection of sample requests that can be used to call your GMS instance.
